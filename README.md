The main objective of Roxiler Frontend is to provide users with an intuitive and interactive platform to explore and analyze data in a graphical format. The project leverages various frontend technologies and frameworks to achieve this goal.
##Tech-stack
1. React
2. ExpressJS
3. NodeJS
4. MongoDB
## Features

### Data Visualization: Roxiler Frontend offers various types of graphs and charts, such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots. These visualizations help users gain insights and identify patterns within the provided dataset.

###  Interactive UI: The project focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the data visually. Users can zoom in/out, hover over data points for additional information, and dynamically update the displayed data based on user inputs.

###  Data Filtering and Sorting: Roxiler Frontend enables users to filter and sort the data based on specific criteria. This feature enhances data exploration and facilitates a deeper analysis of the dataset.

 ###  Data Export: Roxiler Frontend allows users to export the displayed data and graphs in different formats, such as CSV or image files. This feature enables users to share their findings or use the data in other applications easily.

## design decisions or assumptions
Decision was to build simple design where we can simply show the data filtering and sorting.Data visulization was also a task
